The knowledge of equilibrium constant helps us to
1. predict the direction in which the net reaction will take place
2. predict the extent of the reaction and
3. calculate the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products.
It is to be noted that these constants do not provide any information regarding the rates of
the forward or reverse reactions.

8.7.1 Predicting the extent of a reaction

The value of equilibrium constant, K<sub>c</sub>
 tells us the extent of a reaction, i.e., it indicates
how far the reaction has proceeded towards product formation at a given temperature.
A large value of K<sub>c</sub>
indicates that the reaction reaches equilibrium with high product yield. On the other hand, a low value of K<sub>c</sub>
indicates that the reaction reaches equilibrium with low product yield. In general, if the K<sub>c</sub> is greater than the 10<sup>3</sup>, the reaction proceeds nearly to completion. If it is less than 10<sup>-3</sup>, the reaction rarely proceeds. If K<sub>c</sub> is in the range 10<sub>-3</sub> to10<sup>3</sup>, significant amount of both reactants and products are present at equilibrium. 

**Table 8.2 Dependence of extent of reaction on K<sub>c</sub>**

| Value of K<sub>c</sub> |K<sub>c</sub>  < 10<sup>-3</sup> |10<sup>-3</sup>   < K<sub>c</sub> < 10<sup>3</sup> |K<sub>c</sub>  > 10<sup>3</sup> |
|------|------|------|------|
| Relative concentrations of reactants and products |[Products] << [Reactants] |Signicant quantity of Products and Reactants |[Products] >> [Reactants] |
| Extent of reaction |Reaction makes a little progress in the forward direction |Both the forward and backward reactions  make signicant progress |Reaction nearly goes to completion |
| Prediction |Reverse reaction is favoured |Neither for ward nor reverse reaction predominates |For ward reaction is favoured |
| Examples |Decomposition of water at 500K 2H<sub>2</sub>O(g)⇌2H2(g)+O<sub>2</sub>(g) K<sub>c</sub> = 4.1 × 10<sup>-48</sup> Oxidation of nitrogen at 1000 K N<sub>2</sub>(g)+O<sub>2</sub>(g)⇌2NO(g) K<sub>c</sub> = 1× 10<sup>-30</sup> |Dissociation of bromine monochloride at 1000 K 2BrCl(g)⇌Br<sub>2</sub>(g)+Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) K<sub>c</sub> = 5 Formation of HI at 700K H<sub>2</sub>(g)+I<sub>2</sub>(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)      K<sub>c</sub> = 57.0|Formation of HCl at 300K H<sub>2</sub>(g) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) ⇌ 2HCl (g) K<sub>c</sub> = 4 × 10<sup>31</sup> Oxidation of carbon monoxide at 1000 K 2CO(g)+O<sub>2</sub>(g)⇌2CO<sub>2</sub>(g) K<sub>c</sub> = 2.2 × 10<sup>22</sup> |

**Example**

Consider the following equilibrium reactions and relate their equilibrium constants

1. N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ 2NO ; K<sub>1</sub>

2. 2NO + O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ 2NO<sub>2</sub>; K<sub>2</sub>

3. N<sub>2</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> ⇌ 2NO<sub>2</sub>; K<sub>3</sub>

K_1 = \frac{[NO]^2}{[N_2][O_2]}            
\newline
K_2 = \frac{[NO_2]^2}{[N_2][O_2]}           
\newline
Now, K_1 × K_2 = \frac{[NO]^2}{[N_2][O_2]} × \frac{[NO_2]^2}{[N_2][O_2]} 
\newline
= \frac{[NO_2]^2}{[N_2][O_2]^2} = K_3
\newline
∴ K_3 = K_1 × K_2

8.7.2 Predicting the direction of a reaction

From the knowledge of equilibrium constant, it is possible to predict the direction in which the net reaction is taking place for a given concentration or partial pressure of reactants and products.

Consider a general homogeneous reversible reaction,

xA + yB ⇌ lC + mD
|---------|

For the above reaction under non- equilibrium conditions, reaction quotient ‘Q’ is defined as the ratio of the product of active masses of reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to that of the reactants.

Under non-equilibrium conditions, the reaction quotient Q can be calculated using the following expression.

Q =[C]<sup>l</sup> [D]<sup>m</sup> / [A]<sup>x</sup> [B]<sup>y</sup>
|----|

As the reaction proceeds, there is a continuous change in the concentration of reactants and products and also the Q value until the reaction reaches the equilibrium. At equilibrium Q is equal to K<sub>c</sub> at a particular temperature. Once the equilibrium is attained, there is no change in the Q value. By knowing the Q value, we can predict the direction of the reaction by comparing it with K<sub>c</sub>.

• If Q = K<sub>c</sub>, the reaction is in equilibrium state.

• If Q > K<sub>c</sub>, the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction i.e., formation of reactants.

• If Q < K<sub>c</sub>, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction i.e., formation of products.

Example 1

The value of K<sub>c</sub> for the following reaction at 717 K is 48.

H<sub>c</sub>(g) + I<sub>c</sub>(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)
|----|

At a particular instant, the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>and HI are found to be 0.2 mol L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.2 mol L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.6 mol L<sup>-1</sup> respectively. From the above information we can predict the direction of reaction as follows.

Since Q<K<sub>c</sub>, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction.

{{<katex display>}}
Q = \frac{[HI]^2}{[H_2][I_2]} = \frac{0.6 \times 0.6}{0.2 \times 0.2} = 9
{{</katex>}}
|----|

Example 2

The value of K<sub>c</sub> for the reaction

N2O<sub>4</sub> (g) ⇌ 2NO<sub>2</sub>(g)
|---|

K<sub>c</sub> = 0.21 at 373 K. The concentrations N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> are found to be 0.125 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> and 0.5 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> respectively at a given time. From the above information we can predict the direction of reaction as follows.

{{<katex display>}}
Q = \frac{[NO_2]^2}{[N_2][O_4]} = \frac{0.5 \times 0.5}{-0.125} = 2
{{</katex>}}
|----|

The Q value is greater than K<sub>c</sub>. Hence, the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction until the Q value reaches 0.21

**8.7.3 Calculation of concentration of reactants and products at equilibrium**

If the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products are known for a reaction, then the equilibrium constant can be calculated and vice versa.

Let us consider the formation of HI in which, ‘a’ moles of hydrogen and ‘b’ moles of iodine gas are allowed to react in a container of volume V. Let ‘x’ moles of each of H<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> react together to form 2x moles of HI.

H<sub>2</sub> (g)+ I<sub>2</sub> (g) ⇌ 2HI(g)
|----|

| |H<sub>2</sub> |I<sub>2</sub> |HI |
|------|------|------|------|
| Initial number of moles |a |b |0 |
| number of moles reacted |x |x |0 |
| Number of moles at equilibrium |a-x |b-x|2x |
| Active mass or molar concentration at equilibrium |a-x/V |b-x/V |2x/V |

Applying law of mass action,

The equilibrium constant K<sub>p</sub> can also be calculated as follows:

We know the relationship between the K<sub>c</sub> and K<sub>p</sub>

K<sub>p</sub> = K<sub>C</sub>(RT)<sup>Δn<sub>g</sub></sup>
|----|

Here the

Δng = n<sub>p</sub> – n<sub>r</sub> = 2 – 2 = 0
|---|

Hence K<sub>p</sub> = K<sub>c</sub>

K<sub>p</sub> = 4x<sup>2</sup>/(a-x)(b-x)
|----|

**Solved Problem**

One mole of H<sub>2</sub> and one mole of I<sub>2</sub> are allowed to attain equilibrium in 1 lit container. If the equilibrium mixture contains 0.4 mole of HI. Calculate the equilibrium constant.

**Given data:**

[H<sub>2</sub>] = 1 mol L-1 [I<sub>2</sub>] = 1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> 

At equilibrium, [HI] = 0.4 mol L<sup>-1</sup> K<sub>c</sub>= ?

**Solution:**

H<sub>2</sub>(g) + I<sub>2</sub>(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)

| | H<sub>2</sub> |I<sub>2</sub> |HI |
|------|------|------|------|
| Initial number of moles |1 |1 |- |
| Number of moles at equilibrium |1-x |1-x |2x = 0.4.x=0.2 |
| | 0.8 |0.8 |0.4 |

**Dissociation of PCl<sub>5</sub>:**

Consider that ‘a’ moles of PCl<sub>5</sub> is taken in a container of volume V. Let ‘x’ moles of PCl<sub>5</sub> be dissociated into x moles of PCl<sub>3</sub> and x moles of Cl<sub>2</sub>.  

PCl<sub>5</sub>(g) ⇌ PCl<sub>3</sub>(g) + Cl2(g)
|--|


| |PCl<sub>5</sub> |PCl<sub>3</sub> |Cl<sub>2</sub> |
|------|------|------|------|
| Initial number of moles |a |0 |0 |
| number of moles dissociated |x |0 |0 |
| Number of moles at equilibrium |a-x |x |x |
| Active mass or molar concentration at equilibrium |a-x/V |x/V |x/V |

Applying law of mass action,

The equilibrium constant K<sub>p</sub> can also be calculated as follows:

We know the relationship between the K<sub>c</sub> and K<sub>p</sub>

K<sub>p</sub> = K<sub>C</sub>(RT)<sup>Δn<sub>g</sub></sup>
|----|

Here the

Δng = n<sub>p</sub> – n<sub>r</sub> = 2 – 1 = 1
|---|

Hence Kp = Kc (RT)

We know that PV = nRT

RT = PV/n
|----|

Where n is the total number of moles at equilibrium. 

n = (a-x) + x + x = (a+x)

**Synthesis of ammonia:**

Let us consider the formation of ammonia in which, ‘a’ moles nitrogen and ‘b’ moles hydrogen gas are allowed to react in a container of volume V. Let ‘x’ moles of nitrogen react with 3x moles of hydrogen to give 2x moles of ammonia.

N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) ⇌ 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g)

| |N<sub>2</sub> |H<sub>2</sub> |NH<sub>3</sub> |
|------|------|------|------|
| Initial number of moles |a |b |0 |
| number of moles reacted |x |3x |0 |
| Number of moles at equilibrium |a-x |b-3x |2x |
| Active mass or molar concentration at equilibrium |a-x/V |b-X/3V |2xV |

Applying law of mass action,

The equilibrium constant Kp can also be calculated as follows:

K<sub>p</sub> = K<sub>C</sub>(RT)<sup>Δn<sub>g</sub></sup>
|----|

Δng = n<sub>p</sub> – n<sub>r</sub> = 2 – 4 = -2
|---|

Total number of moles at equilibrium,

n= a-x + b-3x+ 2x = a+b-2x
