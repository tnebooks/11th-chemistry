 **14.1 INTRODUCTION**

In the previous unit we learnt about the
chemistry of hydrocarbons. In this unit us learn about
organic compounds containing halogens. When one
or more hydrogen atoms of aliphatic or aromatic
hydrocarbons are replaced by the corresponding
number of halogens like fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, the resultant compounds are called either haloalkanes or halo arenes. They
serve as starting materials for many organic synthesis.
Halogen substituted organic compounds are widely spread in nature and
find application in our day to day life as well as in industry. Certain compounds like
chloramphenicol produced by soil microbes are used in the treatment of typhoid;
chloroquine is used in the treatment of malaria, halothane is used as an anesthetic, and
halogenated solvents like trichloroethylene are used for cleaning electronic equipments.
