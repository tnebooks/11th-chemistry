Trihaloalkanes are compounds obtained by replacing three hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon by three halogen atoms.  

**Example**

CHCl3 CHI3

Chloroform Iodoform

**1) Chloroform**

Chloroform is an important trihaloalkane. Dumas named CHCl3 as chloroform as it gives formic acid on hydrolysis.

**Preparation:**

Chloroform is prepared in the laboratory by the reaction between ethyl alcohol with bleaching powderfollowed by the distillation of the product chloroform. Bleaching powder act as a source of chlorine and calcium hydroxide. This reaction is called haloform reaction. The reaction proceeds in three steps as shown below.

**Step – 1: Oxidation**

CH3CH2OH + Cl2 → CH3CHO + 2HCl

Ethyl alcohol Acetaldehyde

**Step – 2: Chlorination**

CH3CHO + 3Cl2 → CCl3CHO + 3HCl

Acetaldehyde Trichloro acetaldehyde

**Step – 3: Hydrolysis**

2CCl3CHO + Ca(OH)2 → 2CHCl3 + (HCOO)2 Ca

Chloral chloroform




  

**Properties**

**Physical properties**

(i) Chloroform is a colourless liquid with peculiar sickly smell and a burning taste

(ii) The vapours of chloroform when inhaled it causes unconsciousness (depress the central nervous system) and hence it is used as an anaesthetic.

**Chemical properties**

**1) Oxidation**

Chloroform undergoes oxidation in the presence of light and air to form phosgene (carbonyl chloride)

CHCl3 + 1 2 O2

air light

Since phosgene is very poisonous, its presence makes chloroform unfit for use as anaesthetic.

**2) Reduction**

Chloroform undergoes reduction with zinc and HCl in the presence of ethyl alcohol to form methylene chloride.

It used as an insecticide and soil sterilising agent.

**4) Carbylamine reaction**

liquid with its specific smell

(ii) It is insoluble in water and soluble in organic solvents

**14.6.4 Freons (CFC)** The chloro fluoro derivatives of methane and ethane are called freons.  

**Nomenclature** Freon is represented as Freon-cba

Where c = number of carbon atoms – 1

b = number of hydrogen atoms + 1

a = total number of fluorine atoms

**Example**

**Formula C–1 H+1 F Name** CFCl3 1–1=0 0+1=1 1 Freon–11 CF2Cl2 1–1=0 0+1=1 2 Freon–12

C2F2Cl4 2–1=1 0+1=1 2 Freon– 112

C2F3Cl3 2–1=1 0+1=1 3 Freon- 113

Freon – 12 is prepared by the action of hydrogen fluoride on carbon tetrachloride in the presence of catalylic amount of antimony pentachloride. This is called swartz reaction.

**Physical properties**

Freons are highly stable, unreactive, non corrosive, non toxic, easily liquefiable gases.

**Uses:** (i) Freons are a used as refrigerants in

refrigerators and air conditioners. (ii) It is used as a propellant for aerosols

and foams

(iii) It is used as propellant for foams to spray out deodorants, shaving creams, and insecticides.

**14.6.5 DDT (p,p’-dichloro diphenyl tri- chloro ethane)** DDT, the first chlorinated organic pesticide was prepared in 1873, and in 1939 Paul Muller discovered the effectiveness of DDT as an insecticide. He was awarded Noble prize in medicine and physiology in 1948 for this discovery. DDT can be prepared by heating a mixture of chlorobenzene with chloral (Trichloro acetaldehyde) in the presence of Conc.H2SO4.

**Uses:** i) DDT is used to control certain insects

which carries diseases like malaria and yellow fever

ii) It is used in farms to control some agricultural pests

iii) It is used in building construction as pest control

iv) It is used to kill various insects like housefly and mosquitoes due to its high and specific toxicity.  

**SUMMARY**

• The compounds obtained by the substitution of hydrogen atom of alkanes by halogen atom are called haloalkane, while the compounds obtained by the substitution of hydrogen atoms of arenes by halogen atom are called haloarenes.

• Modern classification of halo compounds is based on the halogen with carbon possessing sp3 hybridisation. In these compounds the electronegativity of halogen is more than that of carbon, hence Cδ+ – Xδ- bond becomes polar.

• Haloalkane

• Haloalkanes are prepared from alkanes, alkenes or alcohols. The boiling points of haloalkane are higher than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.

• Haloalkane undergoes nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions. Primary alkyl halides undergo SN2 mechanism. If the reactant is chiral, the product formed exhibits inversion of stereo chemical configuration Tertiary alkyl halide undergoes SN1 mechanism, via carbonium ion formation. If the reactant is chiral, the product formed is optically inactive due to racemisation.

• Organo metallic compound

• Haloalkane reacts with metal to form organometallic compounds like Grignard reagent. It is represented as Rδ-–Mgδ+X. Grignard reagent reacts with variety of substances to give almost all class of organic compounds like alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids etc.

• Haloarenes




  

• Haloarenes are prepared from arenes or by decomposition of benzene diazonium chloride. Haloarenes are more stable than haloalkane. C – X bond in halo arenes is short and strong.

• Under normal conditions halo arenes do not undergo nucleophilic substitution but takes part in electrophilic substitution. Electron withdrawing inductive effect of halogen atom deactivates the benzene ring whereas resonating structure control o, p directing nature of halo arenes.

• Poly halogen compounds

• Organic compounds having two or more halogen atoms are called poly halogen compounds. These compounds are useful in our day to day life but pose environmental threat.

• Chloroform is used as an anasthetic, but because of its toxic nature it has been replaced by less toxic and safer anaesthetic like ethers.

• Iodoform is used as an antiseptic, due to the liberation of free iodine. But it has been replaced by other formulation containing iodine, due to its objectional smell.

• Carbon tetrachloride is used in fire extinguishers. Freons are used as refrigerant. But both these compounds lead to adverse environmental effect.

• DDT is used an effective insecticide. Now a days it is banned because of it's long term toxic effect.
