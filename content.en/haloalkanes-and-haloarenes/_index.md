C X δ−δ+

The C –X bond is formed by overlap of sp3 orbital of carbon atom with half filled p-orbital of the halogen atom. The atomic size of halogen increases from fluorine to iodine, which increases the C – X bond length. Larger the size, greater is the bond length, and weaker is the bond formed. The bond strength of C – X decreases from C – F to C – I in CH3X. The changes in the value of bond length, bond enthalpy and bond polarity, as we move from C –F to C –I, is given in the table.

**14.3.3 Methods of preparation**

Haloalkanes are prepared by the following methods

**1) From alcohols**

Alcohols can be converted into halo alkanes by reacting it with any one of the following reagent 1. hydrogen halide 2. Phosphorous halides 3. Thionyl chloride  

**a)Reaction with hydrogen halide** Anhydrous

ZnCl2CH3CH2OH+HCl Ethanol

CH3CH2Cl+H2O Chloroethane

The order of reactivity of halo acids with alcohol is in the order HI > HBr > HCl. The order of reactivity of alcohols with halo acid is tertiary > secondary > primary.

**b)Reaction with phosphorous halides** Alcohols react with PX5 or PX3 to form haloalkane. PBr3 and PI3 are usually generated in situ (produced in the reaction mixture) by the reaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine, respectively.

**Example**

CH3CH2OH + PCl5 Ethanol

**Example**

CH3CH2OH + SOCl2

Ethanol

Chloroethane CH3CH2Cl+SO2↑+HCl↑

Pyridine

This reaction is known as **Darzen's halogenation**

**2) From alkenes**

Alkenes react with halogen acids (HCl, HBr, HI) to give haloalkane. The mode of addition follows Markovnikov’s rule.

**3) From alkanes**

Alkanes react with halogens (Cl2 or Br2) in the presence of ultra violet light to form haloalkane. This reaction is a free radical substitution reaction and gives a mixture of mono, di or poly substituted haloalkane.

**Example**

Chlorination of methane gives different products which have differences in the boiling points. Hence, these can be separated by fractional distillation.

CH3CH2Br + NaI Acetone

∆ Bromoethane

CH3CH2I + NaBr Iodoethane

**b) Swarts reaction**

Chloro or bromo alkanes on heating with metallic fluorides like AgF, SbF3 or Hg2F2 gives fluoro alkanes. This reactions is called Swarts reaction.

**Example**

CH3CH2Br + AgF Bromo ethane

CH3CH2F + AgBr Fluoro ethane

**5) From silver salts of fatty acids (Hunsdiccker reaction)**

Silver salts of fatty acids when refluxed with bromine in CCl4 gives bromo alkane

CH3CH2COOAg + Br2 Silver propionate

**14.3.4 Physical Properties**

1\. Pure haloalkanes are colourless. Bromo and iodo alkanes are coloured in the presence of light.

2. Haloalkanes having one, two or three carbon atoms are in the gaseous state at normal temperature. Haloalkanes having more than three carbon atoms are liquids or solids.

**3\. Boiling point and Melting point**

i) Haloalkanes have higher boiling point and melting point than the parent alkanes having the same number of carbons because the intermolecular forces of attraction (dipole – dipole interaction and vander Waals forces) are stronger in haloalkane.

ii) The boiling point and melting point of haloalkanes decreases with respect to the helogen in the following order.

**Example**

CH3I > CH3Br > CH3Cl > CH3F

iii) The boiling points of chloro, bromo and iodo alkanes increase with the increase in the number of halogen atoms.

**For Example:**

CCl4 > CHCl3 > CH2Cl2 > CH3Cl  

iv) The boiling point and melting point of mono haloalkane increase with the increase in the number of carbon atoms.

**Example**

CH3CH2CH2Cl > CH3CH2Cl > CH3Cl

v) Among isomeric alkyl halides the boiling point decreases with the increase in branching in the alkyl group; with increase in branching, the molecule attains spherical shape with less surface area. As a result the inter molecular forces become weak, resulting in lower boiling points.

**4\. Solubility**

Haloalkanes are polar covalent compounds soluble in organic solvents, but insoluble in water because they cannot form hydrogen bonds with water molecules




  

**5\. Density**

The density of liquid alkyl halides are higher than these of hydrocarbons of comparable molecular weight.

**14.3.5 Chemical properties**

Haloalkanes are one of the most reactive classes of organic compounds. Their reactivity is due to the presence of polar carbon – halogen bond in their molecules. The reactions of haloalkane may be divided into the following types

i) Nucleophilic substitution reactions

ii) Elimination reactions

iii) Reaction with metals

iv) Reduction

**1) Nucleophilic substitution reactions**

We know that the Cδ+ - Xδ- present in halo alkane is polar and hence the nucleophilic reagents are attracted by partially positively charged carbon atoms resulting in substitution reactions.

**Reaction with aqueous alkali or moist silver oxide.(Hydrolysis)**

Haloalkane reacts with aqueous solution of KOH or moist silver oxide (Ag2O/H2O) to form alcohols.  

**Example**

Bromoethane CH3 - CH2 - Br + KOH (aq)

boil

CH3 - CH2 - OH + KBr Ethyl alcohol

Bromoethane

CH 3 - CH 2 - Br + AgOH

boil

CH 3 - CH 2 - OH + AgBr Ethanol

Moist silver oxide

**i) Reaction with alcoholic ammonia (Ammonolysis)** Haloalkanes react with alcoholic ammonia solution to form alkyl amines. **Example**

CH3 – CH2 – Br + H – NH2

Bromo ethane ammonia

CH3 – CH2 – NH2 + HBr Ethyl amine

However, with excess of halo alkane, secondary and tertiary amines along with quartenary ammonium salts are obtained

**Ambident Nucleophiles**

Nucleophiles such as cyanide and nitrite ion which can attack nucleophilic centre from two sides of the nucleophile are called ambident nucleophiles. These nucleophiles can attack with either of the two sides depending upon the reaction conditions and the reagent used.

**ii) Reaction with alcoholic KCN**

Haloalkanes react with alcoholic KCN solution to form alkyl cyanides.

**Example**

CH3–CH2–Br+KCN→ Bromoethane Ethyl cyanide

CH3–CH2–CN+KBr

**iii) Reaction with alcoholic AgCN**

Haloalkanes react with alcoholic AgCN solution to form alkyl isocyanide.

**Example**

CH3CH2Br + AgCN CH3CH2NC+AgBr Bromoethane Ethyl isocyanide

**iv) Reaction with sodium or potassi- um nitrite**

Haloalkanes react with alcoholic solution of NaNO2 or KNO2 to form alkyl nitrites.

**Example**

CH3CH2Br + KNO2→CH3CH2–O–N=O+KBr

Bromoethane Ethyl nitrite

**v) Reaction with silver nitrite** Haloalkanes react with alcoholic solution of AgNO2 to form nitro alkanes.  

**Example**

CH3CH2Br+AgNO2→CH3CH2NO2+ AgBr

Bromo ethane Nitro ethane

**vi) Reaction with sodium or potassi- um hydrogen sulphide**

Haloalkanes react with sodium or potassium hydrogen sulphide to form thio alcohols.

**Example**

**vii) Williamson ether synthesis**

Haloalkane, when boiled with sodium alkoxide gives corresponding ethers.

**Example**

This method can be used to prepare mixed (unsymmetrical) ethers also.

CH3CH2Br+NaOCH2CH3

Bromo ethane Sodium ethoxide

CH3CH2OCH2CH3+NaBr diethyl ether

**Mechanism of Nucleophilic substitu- tion reaction**

**The mechanism of nucleophilic** substitution reaction is classified as

a) Bimolecular Nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2)




  

b) Unimolecular Nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN1)

**SN2 Mechanism**

SN2 Bimolecular

Substitution

Nucleophilic

The rate of SN2 reaction depends upon the concentration of both alkyl halide and the nucleophile.

Rate of reaction = k2 \[alkylhalide\]\[nucleophile\]

It follows second order kinetics and occurs in one step.

This reaction involves the formation of a transition state in which both the reactant molecules are partially bonded to each other. The attack of nucleophile occurs from the back side (i.e opposite to the side in which the halogen is attacked). The carbon at which substitution occurs has inverted configuration during the course of reaction just as an umbrella has tendency to invert in a wind storm. This inversion of configuration is called Walden inversion; after paul walden who first discovered the inversion of configuration of a compound in SN2 reaction.

SN2 reaction of an optically active haloalkane is always accompanied by inversion of configuration at the asymmetric centre. Let us consider the following example

When 2 - Bromooctane is heated with sodium hydroxide, 2 – octanol is formed with invesion of configuration. (-)  

– 2 – Bromo octane is heated with sodium hydroxide (+) – 2 – Octanol is formed in which – OH group occupies a position opposite to what bromine had occupied,

**SN1 Mechanism**

SN1 stands for unimolecular nucleophilic substitution

‘S’ stands for substitution

‘N’ stands for nucleophilic

‘1’ stands for unimolecular (one molecule is involved in the rate determining step)

The rate of the following SN1 reaction depends upon the concentration of alkyl halide (RX) and is independent of the concentration of the nucleophile (OH−).

Hence Rate of the reaction = k\[alkyl halide\]

R−Cl + OH− R – OH + Cl−

This SN1 reaction follows first order kinetics and occurs in two steps.




  

We understand SN1 reaction mechanism by taking a reaction between tertiary butyl bromide with aqueous KOH.

The carbocation has 2 equivalent lobes of the vacant 2p orbital, so it can react equally rapidly from either face

**Step - 2**

The nucleophile immediately reacts with the carbocation. This step is fast and hence does not affect the rate of the reactions.

As shown above, the nucleophilic reagent OH- can attack carbocation from both the sides.

In the above example the substrate tert-butyl bromide is not optically active, hence the obtained product is optically inactive. If halo alkane substrate is optically active then, the product obtained will be optically inactive racemic mixture. As nucleophilic reagent OH- can attack carbocation from both the sides, to form equal proportion of dextro and levorotatory optically active isomers which results in optically inactive racemic mixture.

**Example**

Hydrolysis of optically active 2 - bromo butane gives racemic mixture of ± butan-2-ol

**2) Elimination reactions**

When a haloalkane containing a hydrogen on β carbon is treated with an ethanolic solution of potassium hydroxide, an alkene is formed. In this reaction a double bond between α and β carbon is formed by




  

releasing a halogen attached to a α carbon and a hydrogen to a β carbon of halo alkane. This reaction is called β elimination reaction. (dehydrohalogenation).

CH3 CH2 Br+KOHethanol CH2=CH2+KBr+H2O Ethylene

Some haloalkanes yield a mixture of olefins in different amounts. It is explained by Saytzeff ’s Rule, which states that ‘In a dehydrohalogenation reaction, the preferred product is that alkene which has more number of alkyl groups attached to the doubly bonded carbon (more substituted double bond is formed)

**Example** CH3 CH CH2 CH3

alcoholic KOH

Br

CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH3 1-Butene

(Minor product) CH3 - CH = CH - CH3

2-Butene (Major product)

Elimination reactions may proceed through two different mechanisms namely E1 and E2

**E2 reaction mechanism**

E2

Elimination bimolecular

(Second order)

The rate of E2 reaction depends on the concentration of alkyl halide and base

Rate = k \[alkyl halide\]\[base\]

It is therefore, a second order reaction. Generally primary alkyl halide undergoes this reaction in the presence of  

alcoholic KOH. It is a one step process in which the abstraction of the proton from the β carbon and expulsion of halide from the ∝ carbon occur simultaneously. The mechanism is shown below.

**3) Reaction with metals** Haloalkane reacts with metals, to form a compound containing carbon - metal bond known as organometallic compounds.

**a) Grignard reaction**

When a solution of halo alkane in ether is treated with magnesium, we get alkyl magnesium halide known as Grignard reagent.

**Example**

CH3CH2 Br+Mg Dry ether CH3CH2MgBr

Ethyl bromide Ethyl magnesium bromide  

**b) Reaction with active metals like so- dium, lead etc** Haloalkane reacts with active metals like sodium, lead etc in the presence of dry ether to form organo metallic compounds.

CH3 CH2 Br + 2Li Dry ether Ethyl bromide

Ethyl Lithium CH3 CH2Li + LiBr

**4) Reduction reactions** Haloalkanes are reduced to alkanes by treating with H2 in the presence of metal catalyst like nickel, palladium etc or with hydroiodic acid in the presence of red phosphorous.

**14.3.6 Uses of haloalkane Chloroform:** 1. is used as a solvent in pharmaceutical

industry 2. is used for producing pesticides and

drugs 3. is used as an anaesthetic. 4. used as a preservative for anatomical

specimens. **Iodoform:** 1. is used as an antiseptic for dressing

wounds.

**Carbon tetrachloride:** 1\. is used as dry cleaning agent 2. is used as a solvent for oils, fats and waxes 3. As the vapour of CCl4 is non –

combustible, it is used under the name pyrene for extinguishing the fire in oil or petrol. **14.4 Organo metallic Compounds**

Organo metallic compounds are organic compounds in which there is a direct carbon –metal bond. For Example **CH3Mg I - Methyl magnesium iodide CH3CH2MgBr - Ethyl magnesium bromide** The Carbon - Magnesium bond in Grignard reagent is covalent but highly polar. The carbon atom is more electro negative than magnesium. Hence, the carbon atom has partial negative charge and the magnesium atom has partial positive charge

R ----- MgX δ- δ+

**14.4.1. Preparation** When a solution of alkyl halide in ether is allowed to stand over pieces of magnesium metal, the metal gradually dissolves and alkyl magnesium halide (Grignard reagent) is formed. All the reagents used should be pure and dry **Example**

CH3 I Mg dry ether CH3MgI

Iodomethane Methyl magnesium iodide

**14.4.2. Uses of Grignard reagent**

Grignard reagents are synthetically very useful compounds. These reagents are  

converted to various organic compounds like alcohols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes and ketones. The alkyl group being electron rich acts as a carbanion or a nucleophile. They would attack polarized molecules at a point of low electron density. The following reactions illustrate the synthetic uses of Grignard reagent.

**SUMMARY**

• The compounds obtained by the substitution of hydrogen atom of alkanes by halogen atom are called haloalkane, while the compounds obtained by the substitution of hydrogen atoms of arenes by halogen atom are called haloarenes.

• Modern classification of halo compounds is based on the halogen with carbon possessing sp3 hybridisation. In these compounds the electronegativity of halogen is more than that of carbon, hence Cδ+ – Xδ- bond becomes polar.

• Haloalkane

• Haloalkanes are prepared from alkanes, alkenes or alcohols. The boiling points of haloalkane are higher than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.

• Haloalkane undergoes nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions. Primary alkyl halides undergo SN2 mechanism. If the reactant is chiral, the product formed exhibits inversion of stereo chemical configuration Tertiary alkyl halide undergoes SN1 mechanism, via carbonium ion formation. If the reactant is chiral, the product formed is optically inactive due to racemisation.

• Organo metallic compound

• Haloalkane reacts with metal to form organometallic compounds like Grignard reagent. It is represented as Rδ-–Mgδ+X. Grignard reagent reacts with variety of substances to give almost all class of organic compounds like alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids etc.

• Haloarenes




  

• Haloarenes are prepared from arenes or by decomposition of benzene diazonium chloride. Haloarenes are more stable than haloalkane. C – X bond in halo arenes is short and strong.

• Under normal conditions halo arenes do not undergo nucleophilic substitution but takes part in electrophilic substitution. Electron withdrawing inductive effect of halogen atom deactivates the benzene ring whereas resonating structure control o, p directing nature of halo arenes.

• Poly halogen compounds

• Organic compounds having two or more halogen atoms are called poly halogen compounds. These compounds are useful in our day to day life but pose environmental threat.

• Chloroform is used as an anasthetic, but because of its toxic nature it has been replaced by less toxic and safer anaesthetic like ethers.

• Iodoform is used as an antiseptic, due to the liberation of free iodine. But it has been replaced by other formulation containing iodine, due to its objectional smell.

• Carbon tetrachloride is used in fire extinguishers. Freons are used as refrigerant. But both these compounds lead to adverse environmental effect.

• DDT is used an effective insecticide. Now a days it is banned because of it's long term toxic effect.
