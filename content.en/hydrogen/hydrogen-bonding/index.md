Hydrogen bonding is one of the most important natural phenomena occurring in chemical and biological sciences. These interactions play a major role in the structure of proteins and DNA. When a hydrogen atom (H) is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as fluorine (F) or oxygen (O) or nitrogen (N), the bond is polarized. Due to this effect, the polarized hydrogen atom is able to form a weak electrostatic interaction with another electronegative atom present in the vicinity. This interaction is called as a hydrogen bond (20-50 _kJ mol_−_1_) and is denoted by dotted lines (…).

It is weaker than covalent bond (> 100 _kJ mol_−_1_) but stronger than the van der Waals interaction (< 20 _kJ mol_−_1_). Hydrogen bond has profound effect on various physical properties including vapour pressure (H2O and H2S), boiling point, miscibility of liquids (H2O and C2H5OH), surface tension, densities, viscosity, heat of vaporization and fusion, etc. Hydrogen bonds can occur within a molecule (_intramolecular hydrogen bonding_) and between two molecules of the same type or different type (intermolecular _hydrogen bonding_).

# Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond

Intramolecular hydrogen bonds are those which occur within a single molecule.

![Intramolecular hydrogen bonding](twelve.jpg)

**Figure 4.6 Intramolecular hydrogen bonding**  

# Intermolecular hydrogen bond

Intermolecular hydrogen bonds occur between two separate molecules. They can occur between any numbers of like or unlike molecules as long as hydrogen donors and acceptors are present in positions which enable the hydrogen bonding interactions. For example, intermolecular hydrogen bonds can occur between ammonia molecule themselves or between water molecules themselves or between ammonia and water.

Water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with one another. For example, each water molecule is linked to four others through hydrogen bonds. The shorter distances (100 pm) correspond to covalent bonds (solid lines), and the longer distances (180 pm) correspond to hydrogen bonds (dotted lines).

In ice, each atom is surrounded tetrahedrally by four water molecules through hydrogen bonds. That is, the presence of two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electron on oxygen atoms in each water molecule allows formation of a three-dimensional structure. This arrangement creates an open structure, which accounts for the lower density of ice compared with water at 0°C. While in liquid water, unlike ice where hydrogen bonding occurs over a long-range, the strong hydrogen bonding prevails only in a short range and therefore the denser packing.

Hydrogen bond occurs not only in simple molecules but also in complex biomolecules such as proteins, and they are crucial for biological processes.  For example, hydrogen bonds play an important role in the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), since they hold 
together the two helical nucleic acid chains (strands).

# METAL HYDRIDE (HYDROGEN SPONGE)

The best studied binary hydrides 
are the palladium-hydrogen system. 
Hydrogen interacts with palladium 
in a unique way, and forms a limiting monohydride, 
PdH. Upon heating, H atoms diffuse through 
the metal to the surface and recombine to form 
molecular hydrogen. Since no other gas behaves 
this way with palladium, this process has been 
used to separate hydrogen gas from other gases: 
2 Pd (s) + H2
 (g) → 2 PdH (s). 
The hydrogen molecule readily adsorb on the palladium surface, where it dissociates 
into atomic hydrogen. The dissociated atoms dissolve into the interstices or voids 
(octahedral/tetrahedral) of the crystal lattice.
Technically, the formation of metal hydride is by chemical reaction but it behaves like 
a physical storage method, i.e., it is absorbed and released like a water sponge. Such 
a reversible uptake of hydrogen in metals and alloys is also attractive for hydrogen 
storage and for rechargeable metal hydride battery applications.

# The Hydrogen-Future Fuel

The depletion of fossil fuel 
reserves and the threat of global 
warming make the world to 
shift toward alternative fuels. In this regard, 
hydrogen is often considered as a potential 
candidate for this purpose as it is a clean burning 
fuel as it does not produce any pollutants upon 
burning. Hence, hydrogen can directly be used 
as a fuel and can replace existing gasoline 
(petrol)/diesel/kerosene powered engines, and/
or indirectly be used with oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity. However, there 
are some difficulties needs to be overcome. The production cost is high and also uses 
more fossil fuels. Due to its volatile and flammable nature in its native form, it is 
difficult to store and transport. Being the smallest molecule it is prone to leakage.

**SUMMARY**

Hydrogen is the simplest atom which contains one electron and one proton. It has three isotopes namely protium, deuterium and tritium. The hydrogen exists as diatomic gaseous molecule. The molecule has two nuclear spin isomers namely ortho and para- hydrogen. Elemental hydrogen having an electronic configuration of 1s1, has properties similar to alkali metals as well as halogens. Based on its electronic configuration and existence of the +1 oxidation state in most of the compounds it is placed in group 1 along with alkali metals.

Hydrogen is prepared by the action of metal with mineral acids in laboratory. In industrial scale, hydrogen is produced by the steam-reforming of hydrocarbons. Deuterium can be synthesized by the electrolysis of heavy water, while the radioactive tritium is prepared by the nuclear transmutation reaction of lithium with slow neutrons.

Hydrogen reacts with nonmetals like oxygen and halogens to form water and hydrogen halides respectively. It reacts with metals to form metal hydrides. It acts as good reducing agent. Deuterium undergoes  


exchange reactions with hydrogen. Tritium with a half-life period of 12.3 years and emits β-particles spontaneously. Hydrogen has many uses including in the preparation of ammonia, methanol, and hydrogenation of oils and reduction of metal oxides. It can also be used as fuel.

Water is an important amphoteric oxide of hydrogen and used a universal solvent. It hydrolyses oxides and forms metal hydroxides with metals such as sodium and barium. Due to the presence of soluble salts of calcium and magnesium in water, the water shows hardness. Clark's method can be used to remove temporary hardness. Like water, another important oxide is hydrogen peroxide. It is used as a mild antiseptic and as a bleaching agent in textile and paper industries. Hydrogen bound to strong electronegative atoms such as fluorine, nitrogen or oxygen atoms, forms a peculiar type of electrostatic interactions with another strong electronegative atom. This is called hydrogen bond. This is one of important interactions observed in many biological molecules such as proteins, DNA etc…
