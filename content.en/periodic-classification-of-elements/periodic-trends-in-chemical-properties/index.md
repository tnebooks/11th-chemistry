So far, we have studied the periodicity of the physical properties such as atomic radius, ionisation enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity. In addition, the chemical properties such as reactivity, valence, oxidation state etc… also show periodicity to certain extent.

In this section, we will discuss briefly about the periodicity in valence (oxidation state) and anomalous behaviour of second period elements (diagonal relationship).

**Valence or Oxidation States**

The valence of an atom is the combining capacity relative to hydrogen atom. It is usually equal to the total number of electrons in the valence shell or equal to eight minus the number of valence electrons. It is more convenient to use oxidation state in the place of valence.

**Periodicity of Valence or Oxidation States**

The valence of an atom primarily depends on the number of electrons in the
valence shell. As the number of valence electr group, the maximum valence also remains th valence electrons increases, hence the valence alsp increases.

**Table 3.16 Variation of valence in groups**

| Alkali Metals (Group 1) |Group 15 |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Element |No. of electrons in valence shell |Valence |Element |No. of electrons in valence shell |Valence |
| Li |1 |1 |N |5 |3, 5 |
| Na |1 |1 |P |5 |3, 5 |
| K |1 |1 |As |5 |3, 5 |
| Rb |1 |1 |Sb |5 |3, 5 |
| Cs |1 |1 |Bi |5 |3, 5 |
| Fr |1 |1 |



**Table 3.17  Variation of valence in period (1st period)**

| Element |Li |Be |B |C |N |O |F |Ne |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| No. of electrons in valence shell |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |
| Valence (Combining capacity) |1 |2 |3 |4 |5, 3 |6, 2 |7, 1 |8, 0 |

In addition to that some elements have elements of group 15 which have 5 valence ele transition metals and inner transition metals

# Anomalous properties of second period

As we know, the elements of the same properties. However, the first element of eac group in certain properties. For example, li compounds, unlike the alkali and alkaline ea compounds. The elements of the second per valence shell and have a maximum co-valen subsequent periods have more orbitals in the For example, boron forms BF4

–and aluminium  
**Diagonal Relationship**

On moving diagonally across the periodic table, the second and third period elements show certain similarities. Even though the similarity is not same as we see in a group, it is quite pronounced in the following pair of elements.

Li Be B C

Na Mg Al Si

The similarity in properties existing between the diagonally placed elements is called ‘diagonal relationship’.

# Periodic Trends and Chemical Reactivity:

The physical and chemical properties of elements depend on the valence shell electronic configuration as discussed earlier. The elements on the left side of the periodic table have less ionisation energy and readily lose their valence electrons. On the other hand, the elements on right side of the periodic table have high electron affinity and readily accept electrons. As a consequence of this, elements of these extreme ends show high reactivity when compared to the elements present in the middle. The noble gases having completely filled electronic configuration neither accept nor lose their electron readily and hence they are chemically inert in nature.

The ionisation energy is directly related to the metallic character and the elements located in the lower left portion of the periodic table have less ionisation energy and therefore show metallic  

character. On the other hand the elements located in the top right portion have very high ionisation energy and are non- metallic in nature.

Let us analyse the nature of the compounds formed by elements from both sides of the periodic table. Consider the reaction of alkali metals and halogens with oxygen to give the corresponding oxides.

4 Na + O2 → 2 Na2O

2 Cl2 + 7 O2 → 2 Cl2O7

Since sodium oxide reacts with water to give strong base sodium hydroxide, it is a basic oxide. Conversely Cl2O7 gives strong acid called perchloric acid upon reaction with water So, it is an acidic oxide.

Na2O + H2O → 2NaOH

Cl2O7 + H2O → 2 HClO4

Thus, the elements from the two extreme ends of the periodic table behave differently as expected.

As we move down the group, the ionisation energy decreases and the electropositive character of elements increases. Hence, the hydroxides of these elements become more basic. For example,let us consider the nature of the second group hydroxides:

Be(OH)2 amphoteric; Mg(OH)2 weakly basic; Ba(OH)2 strongly basic




  

Beryllium hydroxide reacts with both a

Be(OH)2 + 2HCl → BeCl2 + 2H2O

Be(OH)2 + 2 NaOH → Na2BeO2 + 2H2

**SUMMARY**

The periodic table was developed to systematically arrange the different elements. Lavoisier made the first attempt to arrange the known elements in a particular order based on properties. This followed by Johann Dobereiner, A. E. B. de Chancourtois and Newlands. First meaningful periodic table was constructed by Mendeleeve based on atomic mass. This was later modified based on the modern periodic law which states that the properties of elements are the periodic functions of their atomic numbers. The modern periodic table is made up of 18 groups and 7 periods.

The elements in the same groups have similar properties because their valence shell electronic configurations are similar. The properties of the elements of the same period differ because they have different valence shell electronic configurations. On the basis of electronic configuration the elements are also classified as s-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. The elements belonging to “s, p, d and f ” blocks have unique characteristic properties. In this table, more than 78% of all known elements are metals. They appear on the left side of the periodic table. Non- metals are located at the top right hand side of the periodic table. Some elements show properties that are characteristic of both metals and non-metals and are called semi- metals or metalloids.
The periodic properties such as atomic radius, ionic radius, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy, electronegativity are possessing periodic trends. The variations of these properties are described in the following scheme.
The elements at the extreme left exhibit strong reducing property whereas the elements at extreme right strong oxidizing property. The reactivity of elements at the centre of the periodic table is low compared to elements at the extreme right and left. The similarity in chemical properties observed between the elements of second and third period which are diagonally related.
