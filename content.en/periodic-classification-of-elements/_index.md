**PERIODIC CLASSIFIC**

"An awareness of the periodic table is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle the world and see how it is built up from the fundamental building blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements **"**

**\- Glenn T. Seaborg**

Glenn T. Seaborg

Glenn Theodore Seaborg received Nobel Prize in 1951 in chemistry for the discoveries of trans-uranium elements. He was the co-discoverer of plutonium and other trans- uranium elements. He along with his colleagues has discovered over a hundred isotopes of other elements. He demonstrated that actinide elements are analogues to rare earth series of lanthanide elements.

**Introduction**

There are millions of chemical compounds existing in nature with different compositions and properties, formed from less than 100 naturally occurring elements.

The discovery of elements is linked with human civilization. In stone age, man has used some metals to suit his needs without knowing that they are elements. Soon he learnt to extract elements from ores and fashion them into his daily life. Over the years, more and more elements were discovered. In 1789, Lavoisier from France, published the first list of chemical elements containing 23 elements after several experimental investigations.

Antoine Lavoisier classified the substances into four groups of elements namely acid-making elements, gas-like elements, metallic elements and earthy elements

**Table 3.1 Lavoisier table**

**acid-making elements**

**gas-like elements**

sulphur light

phosphorus caloric (heat)

charcoal (carbon) oxygen

azote (nitrogen)

hydrogen  

**metallic elements earthy elements**

cobalt, mercury, tin lime (calcium oxide)

copper, nickel, iron magnesia (magne- sium oxide)

gold, lead, silver, zinc barytes (barium sulphate)

manganese, tungten argilla (aluminium oxide)

platina (platinum) silex (silicon diox- ide)

**Variation of Electronegativity in a group:** The electronegativity generally decreases down a group. As we move down a group the atomic radius increases and the nuclear attractive force on the valence electron decreases. Hence, the electronegativity decreases.

Noble gases are assigned zero electronegativity. The electronegativity values of the elements of s-block show the expected decreasing order in a group. Except 13th and 14th group all other p-block elements follow the expected decreasing trend in electronegativity.
